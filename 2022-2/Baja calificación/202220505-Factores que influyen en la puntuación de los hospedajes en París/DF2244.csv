Dear future guests,

# Originaire de l'Ouest de la France sur la côte Atlantique (Vendée), voilà près de 15 ans que je vis sur Paris. Habitant au coeur de la Capitale, je suis sûr que comme moi, vous apprécierez vous y ballader, tant de nombreux lieux sont accessibles à pied. Ainsi, j'aime à rejoindre les quais de Seine en redescendant la rue Oberkampf, puis traversant le Marais, avant de voir enfin le haut des clochers de Notre Dame, derrière l'Hôtel de Ville. Tout comme j'apprécie également passer du temps dans mon Quartier ; considéré par certains comme un lieu ""bobo"", il est également celui des parisiens qui, sortant du bureau, se donnent rendez-vous dans les nombreux bars et restaurants. Bref, Nous aurons peut-être l'occasion de nous rencontrer et moi le plaisir de vous accueillir, pour que vous découvriez de vous même mon lieu de vie. A bientôt. FRED

# Native from Western France, from the Atlantic coast (Vendée), I've been living in Paris for almost 15 years now. I really appreciate the place I am living in as, being in the center of the French capital city, I have access to many of its beauties, which are within walking distance from my flat ; I am sure you will enjoy it too! I particularly love going down the OBERKAMPF street, then through the Marais district, to reach the Seine and catching glimpse of the Notre Dame towers behind the City Hall. But I also appreciate spending time in my neighbourhood ; considered by some as a ""BoBo"" place, it is above all one of the Parisians who wish to meet for a drink after work. In short, I hope we'll have the opportunity to meet so that you discover by yourselves my living place. See you soon. FRED
